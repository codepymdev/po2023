# PO2023 Smart App 

First thing first, you can `clone` the repo `https://github.com/realArafatBen/po2023.git`  

After you have download the repo, open the directory `po2023` 

On your terminal `flutter clean` 
Then `flutter pub get` 

## File Struture
```
lib
    auth // Here is the authenication folder 
        admin // Here is the admin auth folder 
        agent // Here is the agent auth folder 

    dashboard  // Here is the dashboard folder
        admin // admin dashboard folder 
        agent // agent dashboard folder 

    widgets //Here is the widgets folder (If you want to separate your widgets)

    home.dart // There we can have the home dashboard

    splash_screen.dart // Splash screen

## Lastly 
You can also separate your widgets in the widgets folder. All these can change when we start working with state management.
